## Description
This project prints the message from a credentials file named "credentials.ini", for example "Hello world". 
A skeleton credentials file "credentials-skel.ini" is included. 

## Notes
Note on first commit:
The first commit on this project is equal to the first commit made in another fork also made by me.
This is because I decided partway through the project that I'm not going to want to clutter my personal github with all the projects this term.
Thus, I set up a github account with my school email and moved my changes.
